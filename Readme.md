# Bachna Ae Haseeno - Hangman

## Project Description

**Bachna Ae Haseeno - Hangman** is a Python-based text adventure game with a dramatic twist on the classic Hangman game. In this game, you wake up sentenced to death by hanging. Your only way to escape the noose is to guess a hidden word correctly. The game features three difficulty levels, each with progressively harder words, and an engaging narrative backdrop. Every incorrect guess brings you closer to your demise, visualized with classic ASCII Hangman art.

This game was developed during my 3rd semester of B.Tech as a project to practice Python programming, game logic, and narrative-driven gameplay.

## How to Play

**Run the Game**: After downloading the project, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   python Hangman.py
